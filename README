## MAIN FILES (useful for the analysis reported in chapter for springer book)

1. Create the dataset of relevant features using the "Create_dataset.R" file. The features considered are:
        - "Patient"                         
        - "Sex"                             
        - "Race"                            
        - "Type_of_glaucoma"                
        - "yearofglaucoma"                  
        - "Hypertension"                    
        - "Diabetes"                        
        - "Cardiovascular_Dz"               
        - "family_history"                  
        - "IOP"                             
        - "MAP"                             
        - "OPP"                             
        - "HR"                              
        - "visit2"                          
        - "MD"                              
        - "Vert_integrated_rim_area__vol_"  
        - "Horz_integrated_rim_width__area_"
        - "mean_RNFL_thickness"             
        - "Age" 
    
   Then some visits, and also some entire patients, are removed due to  missing data.
   Eventually the NA are imputed through linear regression. 
   At the end of the file we generate "interp_lista_pazienti.RData" useful for the analysis.
   
2. Create the model for HIRWA or MD (choosing the desired covariates) using the files "Model_HIRWA.R" or   
   "Model_MD.R" (using JAGS). 
   They generate "output_modelHIRWA.RData" and "output_modelMD.RData" , respectively.
   N.B. Numeric covariates are always standardized. 
   
3. Plot the IC for the betas and b_is of the two models using the file "plot_IC".

4. For the HIRWA model, identify and study clusters based on the sign of the IC for the b_i using the   
   file "Clustering.R". At the end of the file there are tests to highlight differences between groups.
   
## OTHER FILES (useful for preliminar analysis)

"Descriptive_indexes"
  File used to compute mean and sd for both longitudinal and non longitudinal variables. For longitudi
  nal variables both great mean and mean per visit can be computed.
  
"count_na_reducedVariables"
  File used to compute the percentage of missing data in the dataset in different cases:
    - Total percentage of NA considering the original dataset (115 patients) without inserting skipped       visits
    - Total percentage of NA considering the reduced dataset (108 patients) without inserting skipped 
      visits
    - Total percentage of NA considering the original dataset (115 patients) inserting skipped visits
    - Total percentage of NA considering the reduced dataset (108 patients) inserting skipped visits
    
    - Percentage of NA for MD and HIRWA for the four different situation described above
    
"indexes_model_choice"
  Given the RData of the output model the file can be used to compute the LPML and WAIC index of the 
  model
